Building this site one step at a time

## 0. Setup

> * I will create index.html, the save,remove, reset handlers and listeners, init, log files
> * in listeners folder i put (save, reset and remove files to listen for user actions) and in handler i put (the save, reset and remove files which handles and process the events)

## 1. Data & Log

> * Entries data is already created it is in data folder i create the log file to log the state
> * i don't change in data but in log i add empty log array

## 2. Init

> * i think on window load it should render the user interface with  the current status 
> * but i don't change anything at this time.

## 3. User Story: Creating the index

> * first i have to create the index.html which is default page to the UI
> * i have to change the index file since there is not index i created index.html file
> * what are you changing in them?
