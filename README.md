> Further specifications:
> * If a user inputs the same value twice, you should not save it in your app.  Your lists should never have repeated values
> * After a user has removed a value from your state, they should be able to add it again.

> Be sure to organize your code and structure your development strategy!  You can study the [example projects](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/state/tree/master/example-projects) from this module's repo for an idea of how to do this.
